Modified version of [MSFSAgent](https://github.com/jamescl604/MSFSVoiceAttackPlugin) plugin originally made by jamescl604

This version of MSFSAgent does the same as the original version, except this time the code admits more types of variables in order to be able to trigger more switches and buttons, specially in third party aircraft. This step forward has been accomplished thanks to the work of mpaperno and the tools that his coding of WASimCommander offers.
